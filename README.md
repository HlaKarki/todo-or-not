> TODO or not to do, that is the question

TODO Or Not (#todoon) is, in essence, a simple tool that checks your project for TODO's and FIXME's. You can also integrate this tool into your GitHub workflow via actions, and automate generating issues from the discovered TODO's and FIXME's.

For an example of this in action, check out [this example code](https://github.com/Start-Out/todo-or-not/blob/main/example.py) and the [issues that it yielded](https://github.com/Start-Out/todo-or-not/issues?q=is%3Aissue+author%3Aapp%2Ftodo-or-not+label%3Aexample+)!
